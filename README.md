To showcase some skills, possibly make posts, and as a general resume or place to share info about myself. 

I plan to build the site using a static site generator that has webpack. I will try Gatsby first because it has React.js hot reloading with webpack and I can use React.js like a psuedo templating system... and see if I can add any cool d3.js stuff.
